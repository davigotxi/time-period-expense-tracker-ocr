# time-period-expense-tracker-ocr

A Streamlit app that uses EasyOCR and LLMs to extract structured data from receipts. Upload a receipt image and the AI will parse items, prices, categories, and timestamps - then track your spending over time.

## Features

- **Hybrid OCR** - EasyOCR for Thai/English text extraction + LLM for structuring
- **Ollama support** - Run locally with no API keys (free, offline, private)
- **Gemini support** - Use Google's API as an alternative
- **Review queue** - Accept/reject individual items before saving, edit inline, batch actions
- Spending over time visualization
- Category breakdown with charts
- Transaction history

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fishosp/time-period-expense-tracker-ocr.git
cd time-period-expense-tracker-ocr
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** EasyOCR will download language models (~100MB for Thai + English) on first run.

### 4. Set up LLM backend

#### Option A: Ollama (Recommended - free, local, offline)

1. Install Ollama:

   **Windows:** Download and run the installer from https://ollama.com/download

   **Mac:**
   ```bash
   brew install ollama
   ```

   **Linux:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Pull a model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
   ```

   | Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Best for |
   |-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
   | **qwen2.5:7b** | 4.7GB | Medium | High | Recommended - best for receipts and multilingual |
   | deepseek-r1:8b | 4.9GB | Medium | High | Strong reasoning and accuracy |
   | mistral | 4.1GB | Medium | Good | Good instruction following |
   | llama3.2 | 2.0GB | Fast | Moderate | Quick testing, lower memory |
   | gemma2:9b | 5.4GB | Slow | High | Alternative high accuracy |

3. Start Ollama (runs on http://localhost:11434):

   **Windows:** Runs automatically as a background service after installation.

   **Linux/Mac:**
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

4. Select your model from the dropdown in the app sidebar

#### Option B: Groq (Recommended cloud option - free, fast)

Groq offers free API access with generous limits and excellent multilingual support.

1. Sign up at https://console.groq.com

2. Create an API key from the dashboard

3. Create your `.env` file:

   **Linux/Mac:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   **Windows (PowerShell):**
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit `.env` and add your API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
   ```

5. Select "Groq (Free API)" in the app sidebar

**Available Groq models:**
| Model | Speed | Best for |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **qwen/qwen3-32b** | Fast | Recommended - excellent Thai/multilingual |
| llama-3.3-70b-versatile | Medium | Strong general purpose |
| llama-3.1-8b-instant | Very fast | Quick testing |
| moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905 | Medium | Alternative multilingual |

#### Option C: Gemini API

Get a Gemini API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

1. Upload a receipt image (JPG or PNG)
2. Click "Analyze" to run OCR
3. Review extracted items in the queue:
   - ✅ Check/uncheck items to include or exclude
   - ✏️ Edit individual items (name, price, category)
   - ❌ Reject items you don't want to save
4. Click "Accept Selected" to save to history
5. View spending analytics in the charts below

## OCR Modes

The app supports different OCR and LLM combinations (selectable in the sidebar):

**OCR Method:**
| Mode | How it works |
|------|--------------|
| **Hybrid** (default) | EasyOCR extracts text → LLM structures it |
| **Gemini Only** | Image sent directly to Gemini |

**LLM Backend:**
| Backend | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|
| **Ollama** (default) | Free, offline, private | Requires local setup |
| **Groq** | Free API, fast, great multilingual | Requires internet, API key |
| **Gemini** | No setup, fast | API limits, requires key |

Hybrid mode shows the raw extracted text in an expandable section for debugging.

## Sample Images

The `samples/` folder contains example receipt images for testing.

## How It Works

### Architecture

The tool uses a **two-stage pipeline** to convert receipt images into structured data:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Receipt   │ ──▶ │   EasyOCR   │ ──▶ │     LLM     │ ──▶ Structured JSON
│    Image    │     │  (Stage 1)  │     │  (Stage 2)  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                     Text extraction     Data structuring
```

**Stage 1: Text Extraction (EasyOCR)**
- Detects text regions in the image using deep learning
- Recognizes characters using trained language models (Thai + English)
- Preserves spatial layout by grouping text on the same line using bounding box coordinates
- Outputs raw text with line structure preserved

**Stage 2: Data Structuring (LLM)**
- Takes the raw OCR text as input
- Understands context to identify items, prices, dates
- Categorizes products (Food, Beverage, Snack, etc.)
- Fixes common OCR errors (e.g., 'o' misread as '0')
- Outputs clean JSON array of structured items

### Why Two Stages?

**Why not just use an LLM with vision?**
- Vision LLMs (like Gemini) can read images directly, but they're expensive (API costs) and require internet
- Local vision models need powerful GPUs and are slower

**Why not just use OCR?**
- OCR only extracts text - it doesn't understand what's an item, price, or total
- Receipt formats vary wildly between stores and countries
- LLMs excel at understanding context and structure

The hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds: fast local text extraction + intelligent structuring.

## Asian Language OCR Challenges

### Why Thai (and other Asian languages) are harder to OCR

**1. Character Complexity**
- Thai has 44 consonants, 15 vowels, and 4 tone marks that combine in complex ways
- Characters can stack vertically (vowels above/below consonants)
- No spaces between words - the reader must understand context to segment

```
English:  "Hello World"  (clear word boundaries)
Thai:     "สวัสดีโลก"      (no spaces, vowels wrap around consonants)
```

**2. Font Variations**
- Receipt printers use various fonts, often low-quality thermal printing
- Thai characters are more sensitive to degradation than Latin letters
- Small differences in strokes change meaning entirely

**3. Script Density**
- More visual information packed into the same space
- Similar-looking characters (ก ถ ภ look similar when blurry)
- Numbers can look like letters (0/o, 1/l issues exist in Thai too)

### Why Multilingual Models Matter

Both the OCR stage and the LLM stage need proper multilingual support:

**OCR Stage (EasyOCR)**

EasyOCR uses separate neural network models for each language. When you initialize with `['th', 'en']`:
- Downloads Thai character recognition model (~70MB)
- Downloads English character recognition model (~30MB)
- Runs both models and combines results

Without the Thai model, EasyOCR would:
- Not recognize Thai characters at all
- Output garbage or empty strings
- Miss most of the receipt content

EasyOCR supports 80+ languages. For Asian scripts:
| Language | Script Type | EasyOCR Code |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Thai | Abugida | `th` |
| Chinese (Simplified) | Logographic | `ch_sim` |
| Chinese (Traditional) | Logographic | `ch_tra` |
| Japanese | Mixed | `ja` |
| Korean | Alphabetic | `ko` |

**LLM Stage (Ollama/Gemini)**

Even with perfect OCR, the LLM needs multilingual training to:
- Understand that prices are numbers even when OCR misreads "0" as "o"
- Infer meaning from context when characters are ambiguous
- Handle mixed-language text (Thai product names + English brands)
- Know Thai keywords for "total", "tax", "change" to filter them out

**Recommended LLM models for Asian languages:**
| Model | Asian Language Support | Notes |
|-------|------------------------|-------|
| **qwen2.5:7b** | Excellent | Alibaba model, strong CJK + Thai |
| mistral | Good | Decent multilingual, good at JSON |
| llama3.2 | Moderate | English-focused, struggles with Thai |
| gemma2 | Good | Google model, decent Asian support |
